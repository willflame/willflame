# Hi,

I am a person with high expectations and a desire to know new things.\
I have a degree in Internet Systems.\
I really like to see about new things in the IT field in general, and know that it exists and how best to apply the solution.\
I have some hobbies like Animes, and online games, archery, playing sports, always looking for a balanced life.\
I'm the kind of person that when I decide to join a project I try to wear the shirt and give the best.

## And very fan of D&D
